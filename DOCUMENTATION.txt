           BULLS & BEARS — Word Puzzle Arena
           Project Documentation
================================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
Bulls & Bears is a web-based 5-letter word guessing game. Players register an
account, log in, and try to guess a secret word within 6 attempts and a
4-minute timer. The game provides color-coded feedback after each guess to
help narrow down the answer.

This project was built for the SEF Hackathon 2026 by Team 1.


HOW THE GAME WORKS
------------------
1. Register a new account or log in with an existing one
2. Read the game rules on the Mission Briefing page
3. Click "Let's Play" to start a new round
4. Type a 5-letter word and press Enter or click Submit
5. After each guess, you receive feedback:
   - GREEN (Bull)  = Correct letter in the correct position
   - YELLOW (Bear) = Correct letter in the wrong position
   - GRAY (Miss)   = Letter is not in the word at all
6. Keep guessing until you solve it or run out of attempts/time
7. After the game, you can Play Again or view the Leaderboard


SCORING RULES
-------------
- You get +1 point for successfully guessing the word
- You get +0.1 points for every second remaining on the 4-minute clock
- If you lose, your score is 0 (no negative marking)
- Leaderboard ranks players by highest score, then fastest time


WHAT YOU NEED TO RUN THIS
-------------------------
1. Python 3.9 or newer (download from https://python.org)
2. MySQL 8.x database server (download from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/)
3. A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)


HOW TO SET UP AND RUN
---------------------
Step 1: Make sure MySQL is running on your computer
       - Default login: username = root, password = root
       - The app will create the database automatically

Step 2: Open a terminal/command prompt

Step 3: Navigate to the project folder:
       cd "c:\SEF Hackathon\team1\bulls_and_bears"

Step 4: Install the required Python packages:
       pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 5: Start the application:
       python main.py

Step 6: Open your browser and go to:
       http://127.0.0.1:5000

That's it! The application handles everything else automatically:
  - Creates the database (Bulls_Bears_Game_Scores)
  - Creates all the tables
  - Loads 160+ five-letter words into the database


PROJECT FILES
-------------
There are only 6 files in this project:

  main.py          - The Python server. This is the only file you run.
                     It handles user accounts, the game logic, scoring,
                     and the leaderboard. It also sets up the database
                     automatically when you first run it.

  index.html       - The web page. Contains all four screens of the app:
                     Login/Register, Game Rules, the Game Board, and
                     the Leaderboard. Also has popup windows for viewing
                     game results and editing your profile.

  style.css        - All the visual design. Dark theme with glass-like
                     transparent cards, purple and cyan accent colors,
                     smooth animations, and mobile-friendly layout.

  game.js          - The interactive logic that runs in your browser.
                     Handles switching between screens, sending your
                     guesses to the server, animating the letter tiles,
                     tracking which letters you've used, running the
                     countdown timer, and updating the leaderboard.

  schema.sql       - A reference file showing the database structure.
                     You do NOT need to run this manually — main.py
                     creates the tables automatically.

  requirements.txt - Lists the Python packages needed:
                     flask, mysql-connector-python, werkzeug

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
Problem: "Connection failed" error when starting
   → Make sure MySQL is running and the root/root credentials work
   → Try: mysql -u root -proot (in terminal) to test the connection

Problem: "No words in database" error during gameplay
   → Restart the app with: python main.py
   → This will re-seed the words table if it's empty

Problem: Page looks broken or unstyled
   → Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R for hard refresh)
   → Make sure all 6 files are in the same folder

Problem: Port 5000 already in use
   → Close any other application using port 5000
   → Or change the port in main.py (last line: app.run(port=5001))
